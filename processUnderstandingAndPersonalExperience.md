1. How would you explain the “Software development process”?
The software development process is the structured way of turning a problem or a business goal into a working, reliable solution. For me, it starts with understanding — not just what needs to be built, but why. That includes identifying core use cases, potential edge cases, and how the software fits into the bigger picture. Essentialy what problem is should resolve, or if there's not problem what process it should improve.

After that the focus shifts to design — thinking how the system should be structured, how responsibilities are distributed, and how to keep the codebase scalable and maintainable in the long run. A good design makes the system easier to test, extend, and understand. Or simply said "a good design is your friend".

Then comes implementation, where communication, clarity and discipline matter as much as technical skills. The process doesn't end when the feature is “done” — it also includes testing, iteration based on feedback, handling failures gracefully, and continuously improving both code and collaboration.

In short, it's not just about delivering code — it's about delivering clarity, quality, and long-term value.

2. What is your experience with the Software Development Process?
I’ve been actively involved in software development for several years, working across different types of teams and projects. Over time the range of the tasks kept expanding - from back-end to front-end to infra tasks, from Java to NodeJS to Python. Each task gives you an opportunity to learn something new and improve your grasp on thing. I’ve also taken on responsibilities beyond implementation — participating in design discussions, technical decision-making, and helping introduce good practices in areas like team communication, collaboration, and architecture. Which is awesome — I enjoy that kind of involvement.

I’m used to thinking about systems as a whole — how parts communicate, how to keep complexity under control, and how to create solutions that are both technically sound and aligned with business priorities. I'm comfortable working in structured development cycles with planning, code reviews, and testing, but also flexible enough to adapt to the situation when things move faster.

I enjoy working end-to-end — breaking down features into meaningful chunks, delivering tested and maintainable code, and improving things iteratively based on real usage. I care about clean architecture, readability, long-term maintainability, and making decisions for the right reasons.
